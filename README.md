# Get deps

Make sure you have the 5.2.1-r06 toolchain installed in ~/.anki/vicos-sdk/dist. Also have cmake, make automake, git, and wget. The `get-deps.sh` script will do this for you.

```
./get-deps.sh
```

# Build

(this can only build on Linux)

```
make
```

# Deploy

```
./deploy.sh <ip>
```
